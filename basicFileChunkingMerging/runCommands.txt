the input files should be present in the current directory

Compile
    g++ program.cpp -o <execfilename>
Run
    ./<execfilename>

Enter the filename of input file -> 
    enter chunksprefix (for eg audiochunks for song.mp3 etc)  ->
        enter size of chunks (decide as per input file size , small chunks size for large files would result into large number of chunks)

Output
 1. chunks (individually functionalble chunks for .csv , and .mp3 files but not for .mp4 files)
 2. output.csv or output.mp3 (new output file after combining the chunks)
